# Assigment 1 - Intergrationtesting with jest

We were given the code of a basic movie search webapp using omdbapi and were supposed to make __test__ for atleast 60% of the typescript using __mock__ data and __mock__ functions

## To run the tests

Clone the repo on your own computer then enter the following in the terminal:

- npm i
- npx jest or npm test
- npx parcel src/index.html (if you want to test the website)

## To generate HTML-coverage report

- npx jest --coverage
- open the index.html file in coverage folder with LiveServer.
